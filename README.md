# optimization tools for PHYsics based on Bayesian Optimization ( PHYSBO )
Bayesian optimization has been proven as an effective tool in accelerating scientific discovery.
A standard implementation (e.g., scikit-learn), however, can accommodate only small training data.
PHYSBO is highly scalable due to an efficient protocol that employs Thompson sampling, random feature maps, one-rank Cholesky update and automatic hyperparameter tuning. Technical features are described in [COMBO's document](https://github.com/tsudalab/combo/blob/master/docs/combo_document.pdf).
PHYSBO was developed based on [COMBO](https://github.com/tsudalab/combo) for academic use.

# Document #####################################

# Required Packages ############################
* Python >= 3.6
* numpy
* scipy

# Install ######################################
- From PyPI (recommended)
```bash
    $ pip3 install physbo
```

- From source (for developers)
    1. Install NumPy and Cython before installing PHYSBO
        ```bash
        $ pip3 install numpy Cython
        ```

    1. Download or clone the github repository
        ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/issp-center-dev/PHYSBO
        ```

    1. Run setup.py install
        ``` bash
        $ cd physbo
        $ python3 setup.py install --user
        ```

    1. Note: Do not `import physbo` at the root directory of the repository because `import physbo` does not try to import the installed PHYSBO but one in the repository, which includes Cython codes not compiled.

# Uninstall
```bash
$ pip3 uninstall physbo
```

# Usage
After installation, you can launch the test suite from ['examples/grain_bound/tutorial.ipynb'](examples/grain_bound/tutorial.ipynb).
